# 100 ideas for new 3D components

Ideas that suit the dimensions-ui style: procedural geometry, one or two
physical interactions, every colour exposed as a prop. Each idea lists:

- **Interaction**: what the visitor does with it
- **Sound**: an optional sound, off by default, made in the browser with the
  Web Audio API (no audio files), the way the turntable makes its sound
- **Controls**: the props shown in the library's Customize panel
- **Detail**: the modelling or physics detail that makes it feel real, often a
  joint or contact that has to be right

Every component should also take `autoRotate`, respect reduced motion, and
dispose of its geometry, materials and textures.
